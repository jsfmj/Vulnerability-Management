# Vulnerability-analysis

This project involved performing a vulnerability analysis and exploitation of the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine, a purposely vulnerable environment designed for security training using Nessus and Metasploit.

	•	Vulnerability Assessment: Identified vulnerabilities using Nessus on Kali linux, focusing on critical services such as UnrealIRCd and Apache.
 
	•	Exploitation: Successfully exploited the unrealIRCd vulnerability and got unauthorized access to the target system using metasploit.
 
	•	Remediation Prioritization: Developed a remediation strategy by categorizing vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., CVSS score) and potential business impact, recommending fixes for critical issues such as bind shell backdoors and weak encryption protocols.
 
 	•	Documented findings in a professional vulnerability report and created a detailed remediation roadmap, enhancing system security posture.
